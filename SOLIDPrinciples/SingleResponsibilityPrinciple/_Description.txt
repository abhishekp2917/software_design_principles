Single Responsibilty states that a class should do only one thing and it must have 
single reason to change.

It means that if there is a class or a module which is responsible to perform certain 
task then it shouldn't do another task which is irrelevant to the class or module.

For instance let say we have a class named Book which has attributes related to Book
like author, release date, price etc. Similarly we have a class named Invoice which
is responsible for generating invoices of the books purchased from the store after
calculating the price along with discount and GST. 

This Invoice class has methods such as calculateInvoice, printInvoice and saveInvoice.
As we can see that this class is doing extra task of printing and saving invoice, due 
to which if there is a change in printing and saving logic of invoice then also we 
have to change the Invoice class and thus it violates Single Responsibilty Principle.

To make it follow the principle, we must create a separate class for printing and 
saving invoices and can use that classes object in Invoice class to print and save 
invoices.
